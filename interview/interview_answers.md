# why do you want to join myntra:
* moved to a company having a long history
* moved to a company younger than you; product-oriented
* moved to a company younger than some of my cousins; product-oriented and of which i myself am a customer
* move to a company of which you are a customer as well
* career highlights:
    + citi
        - kickstarting my coding career
        - stage performance
        - leading a cultural event
    + paypal:
        - grew my technical acumen at a really good speed
        - adaptability to a different environment
        - went ahead despite being warned and ended up having a reasonably good time (CSK fan)
        - reasonably good as nothing can still match the enjoyment of joining a company as a grad where you already know a lot of other folks already and have a much better time working together.
* they do not hesitate to try something out of the sort. e.g. closing their website in favour of mobile. although didn't go well but it shows that culture at myntra is open enough to take such decisions and try things out.
* partnership with walmart to take it to next level and integration of myntra with jabong will be a good phase which will offer some interesting challenges.

# are you a team player:
yes indeed. in my opinion it is the basic prerogative for any software developer to be able to work well with the teams because no single person can write the entire code base himself/herself. And even if responsibilities are distributed, you can't create any meaningful impact until and unless you have a synergy in the entire system. in all the teams that i have so far worked in the basic unspoken rule that we have followed is never ask whose bug was it and just focus on fixing the issue at the earliest for the benefit of the entire team. the other aspect is all the design discussions 


# most challenging thing i have worked on:
business level - venmo poc
technically - asyn cache persistence
personally - completing a 50k marathon run (and right now I am on way to become obese to see in how much time I can cut that fat out)


# why did you switched to mechanical:
* i took up mechanical out of my own volition but gradually realised that it would not be able to provide the career that I wished for as it seemed like that the gap between the on-role responsibities and the theory that I am studying is wide enough to not keep me interested enough. And to confirm my apprehension, I heavily interned in core mechanical companies - Yamaha, Mahindra Trucks & Buses and Tata Motors to validate the same. Based on my experiences and my informal chat with fellow guides who mentored me during my internship, I decided to go back to my erstwhile interest of coding and managed to secure a placement offer from Citibank, Pune as an application developer. i learned a lot of skills on the job as my formal education was still mechanical with a few important subjects of computer that i voluntarirly covered to set myself up for the transition. looking back to that day, i would say it turned out to be a good decision as my interest in this field is getting deeper with each passing day.
