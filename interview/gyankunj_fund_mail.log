Hi XYZ,

I am Bharat Gulati, a part of the vounteer group who are helping Gyankunj, an NGO that helps provide better education to the children of Economically Weaker Section (EWS). I got your reference from Chandra Sekhar Vishwanathan (aka Sekhar) Director @PayPal, Chennai under whom I am currently working.

I am writing this mail to seek your support and assistance to help Gyankunj with a funding matter. Recently, Gyankunj was awarded a grant of $2000 towards purchase of technology assets under PayPal's Tech For Good campaign. We were very delighted to hear the news but our euphoria was short-lived as Benevity, the platform through which PayPal disburses the funds to the selected NGOs, mandatorily required an FCRA which Gyankunj did not have and it will be some years to go before it becomes eligible to even apply for the same as the entity is just about an year old. However, on discussing this matter with Sekhar, we got a glimmer of hope when he introduced me to AID India and informed me about our shared goal of working towards providing better education for children belonging to EWS and suggested that it would be great if both entities could come together to create greater impact in the society through mutual coordination and synergy.

Bridging the gap between the learner and the learned takes tonnes of bold steps. In August 2009 the Parlianment of India enacted The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education which made the appropriate government obligated to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and completion of elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age group. Enrollment and admission was only a part of the solution as it is equally important to provide quality teachers to such children in the absence of which they would start dropping out of the school. Even though there is a lot desired to still be done by the appropriate government on their part yet it would be hard to disagree with the fact that solving a problem of such immense scale is not a task of a handful people and it is logical to conclude that higher the number of people who come together to work on tackling it, the earlier the day would arrive when each and every child of our nation get his/her right to proper education. With this belief in his heart, Aman Thakur, an Electrical Engineering Graduate from Delhi College of Engineering left his job at KK Birla Group and decided to play his part towards the larger picture by starting Gyankunj, which currently enagages over 40 students in JJ colony, Bawana one of the epicenter of underprivileged slum areas in Delhi.

Inspired by his belief and vision, I decided to help him out in my capacity and helped Gyankunj secure the aformentioned grant from PayPal under the Tech for Good campaign. At this point, we would like to seek financial affiliation with AID India to help Gyankunj and the various children that Gyankunj supports to get the awarded grant. If you have read this far, we hope that with all your kindness and generosity you will be willing to help our cause and therefore to help you out with your decision and clear out any apprehensions we would certainly be happy to discuss this matter in depth over phone/hangouts/mail, the details of which are provided below.
